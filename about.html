            <h3>High School Student! <span class="animate" style="--i:3;"></span></h3>
            <p>I'm Tanveer Singh, a high school student with a boundless passion for the world of computer science.
                My journey into the captivating realm of technology began back in class 8th during the challenging times
                of lockdown.
                Since then, I've been unwavering in my pursuit of knowledge and expertise in all things
                computer-related.
                From coding and programming to delving into the depths of algorithms and artificial intelligence,
                I thrive on the complexities and possibilities that the field offers. As a computer science student,
                I'm constantly seeking to expand my skills and understanding, eagerly embracing every opportunity to
                learn and grow.
                With a fervent curiosity and dedication to excellence, I'm excited to continue shaping my future in the
                dynamic world of technology.</p>

            <div id="more-info" class="hidden">
                
                <p>
                    In addition to my studies, I have a keen interest in participating in coding competitions and hackathons, 
                    where I have been fortunate enough to win several accolades. My interests also extend to exploring 
                    advancements in AI and machine learning, where I am constantly inspired by the potential they hold 
                    for the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy collaborating with peers on various projects, sharing ideas, and learning from one another. 
                    I believe that teamwork and communication are key to success in any field, especially in technology 
                    where innovation is a team effort. Outside of academics, I love reading tech blogs, watching documentaries 
                    on scientific advancements, and spending time outdoors, soaking in the beauty of nature.
